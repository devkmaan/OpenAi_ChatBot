An OpenAI-based Chatbot is an artificial intelligence-powered conversational agent developed using OpenAI's language models, such as GPT (Generative Pre-trained Transformer). 
These chatbots leverage natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning to understand, generate, and respond to text-based queries.

The deployment using flask is also uploaded, the flask deployment method is used only for private server not for cloud server. 
If you want to upload on cloud you can use pythonanywhere.
#### Future improvements

The current version of the chatbot is a simple prototype for a small project. There are several avenues for improvement, such as - 

1. Using more advanced algorithms for matching the user's input to the pre-defined questions.
2. Integrating natural language processing (NLP) techniques for better understanding of the user's input.
3. Implementing a feedback system for users to rate the relevance of the answers provided by the chatbot.
4. Call the chatGPT (Open AI APIs) to get a relevant answer that is not present in the Q&A dataset.
